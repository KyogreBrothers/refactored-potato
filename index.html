  			<p class="text-muted text-left" >Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu.  Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe.  So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices.  The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days.  Be sure  to book in advance to avoid disappointments.  On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago</p>

		  <p>This 2018 American computer-animated superhero film is one of the most solid animations which aren’t made by Disney or Pixar in a long, long time. Here’s my reasons for why this film deserves all the accolades it has received.

Without a doubt, the best part of this film is it’s animation. It’s the combined talents of 140 animators all working to mix computer-animation with traditional band-drawn comic book techniques which makes this film a literal sight to behold.

The characters are so engaging, but none are quite like Miles Morales. Before, to be honest, he was basically black Spider-Man to even the most hardcore of comic book fans. But now, thanks to this film, he is a far more fleshed-out and developed character with real motivations and relatability.

The story is also complex and real. The amount of attention put into the writing has made this story so believable, despite easily tackling concepts such as multiple realities and super-powered individuals. 

The voice acting is on point. In this film, shout out to Jake Johnson, who’s portrayal as an old and experienced Peter Parker who hasn’t just been through life as Spider-Man but also just the toils of life in general is so entertaining and also interesting. It’s a new look on an iconic character which we’ve never seen before, yet love all the same.

To an extent, the unique aesthetics themselves allow for a few laughs here and there. But there is so much comedy in this fairly emotional rollercoaster of a film that it’s hard to even describe. From personal gags between characters to jokes based on the lives of New York citizens, every funny moment got at least a giggle out of me.

Finally, the soundtrack is on point. Having listened to the album on Spotify multiple times, you can see that many of the songs relate to Miles’ struggle. Each song somehow carefully reflects a key aspect of the film, whether blatantly obvious or a little harder to realise. Also, the genres the songs fall into reflect Miles’ urban upbringing and culture which is really something for an animated film.

Overall, nothing I could say could do this film justice. This is a film that me and so many other comic book fans have been waiting for and oh boy, we were in for a treat. This film was dedicated to the memories of the creators of Spider-Man, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and this film couldn’t have honoured them in any better way.</p>

	   <p>"Madagascar" is one of my all time favorite films. It's very funny, heartwarming, exciting and, as Marty the Zebra would say, "crack-a-lackin'"! I think 6 of my favorite parts in the movie are when Alex was showing of his moves to the people, Marty telling Alex, Gloria and Melman his wish to go to the wild, Alex biting Marty's butt, the penguins knocking the captain of the ship out cold, Marty going to Connecticut, and King Julien's song, "I Like to Move It, Move It". 
Plus, I think David Schwimmer makes an EXCELLENT Melman, especially when he shouts, "AAH! NATURE! It's all over me! GET IT OFF!" 
I also really like the part where Alex panics and runs out of the jungle, back to the beach with his friends close behind him, yelling, "Get me outta here! We HAVE to get outta here! HELP!"

Yesterday, when I was taking a break from my MobyMax math homework, I saw a YouTube video about this guy who said that "Madagascar" was one of his LEAST favorite movies from DreamWorks Animations because he said that the characters talked too much and "never shut up", but since I am such a HUGE fan of the "Madagascar" movie series (from 2005 to 2012) because I have seen them many times before, I don't think they talk too much. I think they talk just about enough. Besides, they are way too hilarious to ignore, anyway!.</p>

  	  <p>I think this movie was a masterpiece. It had so much tension and emotion and it was absolutely amazing! You can definitely feel how the characters felt in the story, and how the plot was well written and detailed. And the ending was so unexpected! This movie will definitely stay in your heart all your life! I would totally recommend this to your children!</p>

          <p class="p_modal">this book "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" by Jeff Kinney is just a wonderful book. Always found it entertaining, it really speaks to me. I am a very experienced reader of many books and novels I have read almost all sorts of books, however I always come back to this one. This book is just so captivating it haunts my thoughts once in a while I cant get enough. I don't know what it is about this book weather it be the comical tones,the serious gritty grounded sides to it or the adventurous aspect, whatever it is Jeff Kinney truly hit home with this masterpiece of a book. This book brings back so many memories for me as well when I saw this in my local library, I just saw it on the shelf. It was like beams of heaven coming off of it attracting me like a light attracts a house fly, I felt like everything that I did in my life lead me to that point, that one moment where I felt so amazing so completed like this was my life's purpose. The sheer energy the book carries just sucked me in like a black hole sucking in a planet, I read the first page and I knew this reading experience was gonna be something special. I read it in a matter of days and I read it once more, I think I even went back and read it a third! This book is just amazing and I love the messages it sends as well, the characters are so amazing like Many,Rodrick,Mom,Dad,Rowley, but the one star that I love is the main character Gregg Heffley. We see him down on his luck at the beginning but towards the end he ascended to a higher plane of existence he became something great. I shared this journey with him as well when he was down on his luck I was down on my luck too. At the end I found a deeper meaning to my life as well, i ascended with Gregg and I became something great as well. I truly love this book please read this wonderful masterpiece of the 21st century be with me and Gregg ascend with us.<br>
